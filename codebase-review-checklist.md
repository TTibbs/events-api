# Codebase Review Checklist

This document serves as a guide for reviewing the Events Platform codebase to ensure everything is defined correctly and there are no issues like hardcoded hacks, duplicate code, false positives, or missing edge cases.

## MVC Structure Review

### Models

- [x] Review models for proper database connections
  - Models use a centralized connection from `db/connection.js`
  - All SQL queries are properly parameterized
- [x] Ensure error handling is consistent
  - Most models return rejected Promises with status and message
  - Some models return null for not found cases instead of rejecting with 404
  - **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling between returning null vs throwing 404
- [x] Check for proper transaction handling
  - No transactions found for multi-step operations that might need atomicity
  - **Issue**: Consider using transactions for operations like event registration + ticket creation
- [x] Verify SQL queries use parameters correctly to prevent SQL injection
  - All queries properly use parameterized queries with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- [x] Check for duplicate code across model files
  - **Issue**: Number conversion is duplicated across all models
  - **Issue**: Common pattern of filtering nulls is duplicated

### Controllers

- [x] Ensure proper separation of concerns
  - Controllers mostly delegate to models appropriately
  - Input validation is mostly in controllers (appropriate)
- [x] Check for consistent error handling
  - Most errors are passed to `next(err)` for global handling
  - Some errors are handled directly with custom responses
  - **Issue**: Inconsistent use of status codes for similar errors
- [x] Verify input validation is thorough
  - Most endpoints validate required fields
  - **Issue**: Some numeric conversions aren't checked for NaN
  - **Issue**: Date validations could be more thorough

### Routes

- [x] Verify all routes are properly defined and match the endpoints.json definition
  - Routes match the documented endpoints
- [x] Check for middleware consistency
  - Authentication middleware is not consistently applied to routes
  - **Issue**: Some routes that should require auth don't have it

## API Endpoint Review

### Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth`)

- [x] Review login functionality
  - Password handling and validation is secure
  - Token generation is appropriate
- [x] Check registration process
  - Input validation is thorough
  - Duplicate username/email checks are in place
- [x] Verify token refresh mechanism
  - Refresh token rotation is implemented for security
  - **Issue**: No checks for token reuse
- [x] Ensure logout functionality works correctly
  - Tokens are properly invalidated on logout

### User Endpoints (`/api/users`)

- [x] Verify CRUD operations
  - Basic CRUD functionality is implemented
- [x] Check input validation
  - Input validation is present but could be more thorough
- [x] Ensure proper error handling for user operations
  - Most error cases are handled
- [x] Verify authentication requirements
  - **Issue**: Some user operations need authentication checks

### Team Endpoints (`/api/teams`)

- [x] Review team creation and management
  - Teams can be created, updated, and deleted
- [x] Verify team member handling
  - Team members can be added with roles
- [x] Check proper validation of team data
  - Basic validation exists for team data
- [x] Ensure team-related permissions are enforced
  - **Issue**: Authorization is not fully implemented for team operations

### Event Endpoints (`/api/events`)

- [x] Check event creation and management
  - Events can be created, updated, and deleted
  - Default values are properly applied
- [x] Verify registration process
  - Registration flow is implemented
  - Validation for registration limits exists
- [x] Review availability calculation
  - Logic handles capacity, date/time constraints
- [x] Ensure proper date/time handling
  - Date comparison logic is present
  - **Issue**: Timezone handling could be more explicit

### Ticket Endpoints (`/api/tickets`)

- [x] Verify ticket creation
  - Tickets are created with unique codes
- [x] Check verification process
  - Verification checks status and event end time
- [x] Ensure status updates work correctly
  - Status updates properly manage used_at timestamps

## Tests Review

- [x] Check test setup and teardown
  - Tests use a common setup and teardown approach
  - Database is seeded before each test
- [x] Verify test isolation
  - Tests are isolated through fresh database seeding
- [x] Look for hardcoded values in tests that might create false positives
  - **Issue**: Some tests rely on specific IDs that could become invalid
  - **Issue**: Date assumptions in tests could lead to failures
- [x] Ensure edge cases are properly tested
  - Most error cases are tested
  - **Issue**: Some authorization edge cases are not fully tested
- [x] Verify that error conditions are properly tested
  - Most error responses are tested

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**

   - **Issue**: Some models return null for not found, others throw 404 errors
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize error handling approach across all models

2. **Missing Transaction Support**

   - **Issue**: Multi-step operations like registration + ticket creation need atomicity
   - **Recommendation**: Add transaction support to ensure data consistency

3. **Duplicate Type Conversion Code**

   - **Issue**: Same code for converting string IDs to numbers is duplicated
   - **Recommendation**: Create a utility function for common conversions

4. **Authentication Gaps**

   - **Issue**: Some endpoints that should require authentication don't have it
   - **Recommendation**: Audit all routes and apply authentication consistently

5. **Date/Time Handling**

   - **Issue**: Timezone handling is implicit rather than explicit
   - **Recommendation**: Make timezone handling explicit to avoid potential issues

6. **Input Validation**

   - **Issue**: Numeric validations don't check for NaN
   - **Recommendation**: Add more thorough validation for all inputs

7. **Hardcoded Test Values**

   - **Issue**: Tests rely on specific IDs and dates that could become invalid
   - **Recommendation**: Refactor tests to be more dynamic and avoid hardcoded assumptions

8. **Edge Case Testing**

   - **Issue**: Authorization edge cases aren't fully tested
   - **Recommendation**: Add tests for various permission scenarios

9. **Potential Race Conditions**
   - **Issue**: Concurrent operations on events with limited capacity
   - **Recommendation**: Add proper locking or transactions for capacity-related operations

## Edge Cases to Verify

- [ ] Handling of expired tokens
- [ ] Proper validation of date/time formats
- [ ] Testing for race conditions in registrations
- [ ] Validation of capacity limits
- [ ] Handling of concurrent operations

## Potential Issues to Look For

1. **Hardcoded Test Values**: Look for hardcoded values in tests that might be masking actual issues
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Ensure errors are handled consistently throughout the codebase
3. **Missing Validations**: Check for incomplete input validation
4. **Duplicate Logic**: Identify repeated code that could be refactored
5. **Database Transaction Issues**: Ensure proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
6. **Date/Time Handling**: Verify proper handling of timezones and date comparisons

Let's systematically go through each section to identify and address any issues.
